# DeepONet_physics_inferring

A framework to use Deep Operator Network to infer unknown parameters of partially-observable physical system. This is created for AME 508 FINAL PROJECT. 

The sample problem we solve here is Allen-Cahn equation.

We first train DeepONet to fit the model across a whole range of parameters space and use gradient descent to infer unknown parameters based on partial measurements.
